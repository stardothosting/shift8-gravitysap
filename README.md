## Field Mapping

### Main Business Partner Fields
| SAP Field | Description | Required | Max Length |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| `CardName` | Business Partner Name | Yes | ~100 chars |
| `EmailAddress` | Email Address | No | Email format |
| `Phone1` | Telephone 1 | No | ~20 chars |
| `Phone2` | Telephone 2 | No | ~20 chars |
| `Cellular` | Mobile Phone | No | ~20 chars |
| `Fax` | Fax Number | No | ~20 chars |
| `Website` | Website URL | No | URL format |

### Address Fields (BPAddresses - appears in General tab)
| SAP Field | Description | Required | Max Length |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| `BPAddresses.Street` | Street Address | No | ~100 chars |
| `BPAddresses.City` | City | No | ~25 chars |
| `BPAddresses.State` | State/Province | No | **3-4 chars** (codes only!) |
| `BPAddresses.ZipCode` | Zip/Postal Code | No | ~20 chars |
| `BPAddresses.Country` | Country | No | 2-letter code |

### Contact Person Fields (ContactEmployees - appears in Contact Persons tab)
| SAP Field | Description | Required | Max Length |
|-----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| `ContactEmployees.FirstName` | Contact First Name | No | ~50 chars |
| `ContactEmployees.LastName` | Contact Last Name | No | ~50 chars |
| `ContactEmployees.Phone1` | Contact Phone | No | ~20 chars |
| `ContactEmployees.E_Mail` | Contact Email | No | Email format |
| `ContactEmployees.Address` | Contact Address | No | ~254 chars |

**Important**: 
- SAP has strict field length limits. Use state codes ("CA" not "California") and country codes ("US" not "United States")
- BPAddresses data appears in the **General tab** of the Business Partner in SAP B1
- ContactEmployees data appears in the **Contact Persons tab** of the Business Partner in SAP B1
- You can map address data to either BPAddresses, ContactEmployees, or both depending on your needs

## WP-CLI Testing (Developers)

Test the complete form submission workflow with real SAP B1 integration:

```bash
wp shift8-gravitysap test_submission --form_id=3
```

This command will:
1. Create a test entry in Gravity Forms
2. Submit to SAP B1
3. Verify data in SAP B1 (field-by-field comparison)
4. Clean up test entry

Perfect for regression testing and debugging!

## Troubleshooting

### Field Length Errors
If you get "Value too long in property" errors:
1. Check that State field uses codes ("CA", "NY", "TX") not full names
2. Verify Country field uses 2-letter codes ("US", "CA", "GB")
3. Keep phone numbers under 20 characters
4. Keep street addresses under 100 characters
5. Keep city names under 25 characters

### Connection Issues
1. Verify SAP Service Layer is running
2. Check endpoint URL format (should end with `/b1s/v1/`)
3. Test credentials in SAP Business One
4. Review debug logs for detailed error information

### Numbering Series Issues
1. Configure numbering series in SAP B1 Administration
2. Go to **Administration > System Initialization > Document Numbering**
3. Set up series for Business Partners
4. Ensure default series are configured
5. Use the **Test Numbering Series** button to verify

## Security Features

- **Password Encryption**: All passwords encrypted using WordPress salts
- **Input Validation**: All data sanitized and validated
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS API communication
- **Access Control**: Admin-only access with capability checks
- **Debug Protection**: Sensitive data automatically redacted from logs

## How It Works

1. User submits Gravity Form with mapped fields
2. Plugin validates form has SAP integration enabled
3. Data mapping occurs between form fields and SAP fields
4. SAP authentication using encrypted credentials
5. Business Partner creation via SAP Service Layer API
6. Success/error logging and entry notes

## Testing

### Unit Tests

cd /path/to/shift8-gravitysap
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/
```

**Test Coverage**: 90 tests, 214 assertions - All passing âœ…

### End-to-End Testing

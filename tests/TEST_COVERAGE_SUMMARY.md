# Test Coverage Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the test coverage for the Shift8 Gravity Forms to SAP Business One integration plugin, with special focus on lessons learned about SAP B1 numbering series and CardCode prefixes.

## Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 90
- **Total Assertions**: 214
- **Test Files**: 5
- **Coverage Areas**: SAP Service, Main Plugin, Admin Interface, Helper Functions, Numbering Series, Field Mapping
- **E2E Testing**: WP-CLI command for end-to-end submission testing with SAP verification

## New Test Suites Added

### 1. NumberingSeriesTest.php
**Purpose**: Tests the critical SAP B1 numbering series and CardCode prefix functionality

**Key Tests**:
- `test_series_field_always_set_on_creation` - Verifies Series is always set when creating BPs
- `test_get_series_for_prefix_returns_correct_series` - Tests prefix-to-series mapping
- `test_get_series_for_prefix_no_existing_bps` - Tests fallback when no BPs exist
- `test_cardcode_never_manually_set` - Verifies CardCode is auto-generated by SAP
- `test_multiple_prefix_series_mapping` - Tests multiple prefix mappings
- `test_bp_creation_with_selected_prefix` - Tests user-selected prefix workflow
- `test_get_available_numbering_series` - Tests series retrieval
- `test_error_when_no_numbering_series` - Tests error handling
- `test_cardcode_prefix_field_removed_before_sap` - Verifies internal field removal
- `test_numbering_series_test_includes_prefix_mapping` - Tests the test button functionality

**Critical Lessons Tested**:
1. **Series Field Required**: SAP B1 requires the Series field to be explicitly set, even if there's a default configured
2. **CardCode Auto-Generation**: CardCode should never be manually set - SAP generates it based on Series
3. **Prefix-to-Series Mapping**: CardCode prefixes are determined by querying existing Business Partners and extracting their Series ID
4. **No CardCodePrefix Field**: CardCodePrefix is plugin-internal and must be removed before sending to SAP

### 2. FieldMappingTest.php
**Purpose**: Tests field mapping and validation logic for Gravity Forms to SAP Business Partner mapping

**Key Tests**:
- `test_cardname_is_required` - Validates CardName requirement
- `test_email_is_required` - Validates EmailAddress requirement
- `test_validation_passes_with_required_fields` - Tests successful validation
- `test_validation_fails_with_empty_field_value` - Tests empty field detection
- `test_map_entry_to_business_partner_basic` - Tests basic field mapping
- `test_map_entry_to_business_partner_with_address` - Tests address field mapping
- `test_unmapped_optional_fields_ignored` - Tests optional field handling
- `test_field_mapping_with_special_characters` - Tests special character handling
- `test_cardtype_defaults_to_customer` - Tests CardType default
- `test_field_mapping_with_long_values` - Tests long value handling
- `test_empty_address_fields_no_address_object` - Tests empty address handling
- `test_validate_field_mapping` - Tests field mapping validation

**Best Practices Tested**:
1. **Required Field Validation**: CardName and EmailAddress must be present and non-empty
2. **Field Sanitization**: All fields are sanitized using WordPress functions
3. **Optional Field Handling**: Unmapped optional fields don't cause errors
4. **Address Validation**: Empty address fields don't create invalid address objects
5. **Contact Person Mapping**: Tests mapping to ContactEmployees fields for Contact Persons tab in SAP B1

## Existing Test Suites

### 3. SAPServiceTest.php (22 tests)
Tests SAP Service Layer communication, authentication, Business Partner creation, and HTTP API interactions.

### 4. MainPluginTest.php (24 tests)
Tests main plugin class, singleton pattern, initialization, activation/deactivation, settings management, and form submission processing.

### 5. AdminInterfaceTest.php (16 tests)
Tests admin interface, settings pages, AJAX handlers, and user interface components.

### 6. HelperFunctionsTest.php (10 tests)
Tests helper functions for encryption, debugging, and utility operations.

## End-to-End Testing with WP-CLI

### WP-CLI Test Command
**Location**: `cli-test-submission.php`
**Command**: `wp shift8-gravitysap test_submission --form_id=<form_id>`

**Purpose**: Provides comprehensive end-to-end testing of the entire form submission workflow with real SAP B1 integration.

**What It Tests**:
1. **Form Configuration Loading**: Loads form settings and SAP integration configuration
2. **Sample Data Generation**: Creates realistic test data for all mapped fields
3. **Entry Creation**: Creates a test entry in Gravity Forms database
4. **Theme Hook Simulation**: Triggers `gform_entry_pre_save` to simulate theme functions (e.g., combining first/last name)
5. **Field Mapping**: Maps Gravity Forms entry data to SAP Business Partner structure
6. **Data Validation**: Validates required fields and field mapping
7. **SAP Submission**: Submits Business Partner to SAP B1 via Service Layer API
8. **Response Verification**: Queries SAP B1 for the created Business Partner and compares field-by-field
9. **Cleanup**: Deletes the test entry from Gravity Forms

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Tests actual SAP B1 communication (not mocked)
- ✅ Verifies data persistence in SAP B1
- ✅ Validates address data in BPAddresses collection
- ✅ Validates Contact Person data in ContactEmployees
- ✅ Compares sent vs. received data field-by-field
- ✅ Provides detailed output with color-coded status indicators
- ✅ Safe cleanup of test data

**Example Output**:
```
✅ SUBMISSION SUCCESSFUL!
CardCode: E00789
CardName: Test User 4348

✅ VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL!
✓ Matched: 10/10 fields
✓ Address.Street: Sample value for Address
✓ Address.City: Toronto
✓ Contact Person: Test User 2289
```

**Usage in Development**:
- Run before committing changes to verify no regressions
- Test new field mappings quickly
- Validate SAP B1 data structure changes
- Debug field mapping issues with real data
- Verify theme function integration

**Advantages Over Unit Tests**:
1. Tests actual SAP B1 API (not mocked)
2. Validates real data persistence
3. Tests complete workflow including theme functions
4. Verifies SAP B1 UI data visibility
5. Catches integration issues that unit tests might miss

## Test Coverage Gaps & Recommendations

### High Priority
1. ~~**Integration Tests**: Add tests that verify the complete workflow from form submission to SAP Business Partner creation~~ ✅ **COMPLETED** - WP-CLI command provides comprehensive E2E testing
2. **Error Recovery**: Test retry logic and error handling for failed submissions
3. **Session Management**: Test SAP session timeout and re-authentication
4. **Concurrent Requests**: Test behavior with multiple simultaneous form submissions
5. **Contact Person Data Verification**: Add unit tests specifically for ContactEmployees field mapping

### Medium Priority
1. **Field Type Variations**: Test all Gravity Forms field types (name, address, phone, etc.)
2. **Multi-Address Support**: Test Business Partners with multiple addresses
3. **Multi-Contact Support**: Test Business Partners with multiple Contact Persons
4. **Character Encoding**: Test international characters and UTF-8 handling
5. **Large Form Submissions**: Test performance with forms containing many fields
6. **Address vs Contact Person**: Test scenarios where address data goes to both BPAddresses and ContactEmployees

### Low Priority
1. **UI Testing**: Add tests for JavaScript retry button functionality
2. **Logging**: Test debug logging output and formatting
3. **Cache Management**: Test transient caching and expiration
4. **Settings Migration**: Test upgrade paths between plugin versions

## WordPress Plugin Testing Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Brain/Monkey Framework
- ✅ Used for mocking WordPress functions without loading WordPress core
- ✅ Allows fast, isolated unit tests
- ✅ Properly mocked all WordPress functions (wp_remote_request, get_option, etc.)

### 2. Test Isolation
- ✅ Each test has proper setUp() and tearDown()
- ✅ Tests don't depend on each other
- ✅ Mocks are reset between tests

### 3. Reflection for Private Methods
- ✅ Used ReflectionClass to test private methods when necessary
- ✅ Maintains encapsulation while ensuring thorough testing

### 4. Mock Data Strategies
- ✅ Sequential HTTP response mocking for complex workflows
- ✅ Realistic SAP API response structures
- ✅ Edge case testing (empty values, long strings, special characters)

### 5. Assertion Quality
- ✅ Specific assertions with descriptive messages
- ✅ Tests both positive and negative cases
- ✅ Validates data types, array structures, and field presence

## SAP B1 API Testing Best Practices

### 1. Authentication Mocking
- ✅ Mocked SAP login responses with SessionId
- ✅ Tested authentication failure scenarios
- ✅ Verified session management

### 2. Business Partner Creation
- ✅ Mocked complete BP creation workflow
- ✅ Tested required field validation
- ✅ Verified Series and CardCode handling

### 3. OData Query Mocking
- ✅ Mocked $filter, $select, $top queries
- ✅ Tested empty result sets
- ✅ Verified response parsing

### 4. Error Response Handling
- ✅ Mocked SAP error responses with proper structure
- ✅ Tested error message extraction
- ✅ Verified exception throwing

## Known Test Limitations

### Current Status
✅ **All 90 unit tests pass** (214 assertions)

The unit test suite is stable and comprehensive. All tests pass consistently.

### Areas Not Covered by Unit Tests
1. ~~**Actual SAP Communication**: Tests use mocks, not real SAP connections~~ ✅ **NOW COVERED** - WP-CLI E2E command tests real SAP B1 API
2. ~~**WordPress Database**: Tests don't interact with actual WordPress database~~ ✅ **NOW COVERED** - WP-CLI E2E command creates/deletes real entries
3. ~~**Gravity Forms Integration**: Tests mock Gravity Forms functions~~ ✅ **NOW COVERED** - WP-CLI E2E command uses real Gravity Forms API
4. **Browser/JavaScript**: No tests for client-side retry button functionality (low priority)

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests (Fast, Isolated)
```bash
cd /path/to/shift8-gravitysap
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/
```

### Specific Test Suite
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/NumberingSeriesTest.php
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/FieldMappingTest.php
```

### With Coverage Report
```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/ --coverage-html tests/coverage/html
```

### End-to-End Test (Real SAP B1 Integration)
```bash
# Test form submission with real SAP B1 API
wp shift8-gravitysap test_submission --form_id=3

# This will:
# 1. Create a test entry in Gravity Forms
# 2. Submit to SAP B1
# 3. Verify data in SAP B1
# 4. Clean up test entry
```

### Recommended Testing Workflow
1. **During Development**: Run unit tests frequently (`vendor/bin/phpunit tests/unit/`)
2. **Before Committing**: Run E2E test (`wp shift8-gravitysap test_submission --form_id=<id>`)
3. **After Major Changes**: Run both unit tests and E2E test
4. **Before Release**: Full test suite + manual UI testing

## Future Test Improvements

### 1. ~~Add Integration Tests~~ ✅ **COMPLETED**
~~Create `tests/integration/` directory with tests that:~~
- ~~Use WordPress test suite (WP_UnitTestCase)~~
- ~~Test actual database interactions~~
- ~~Verify Gravity Forms hooks fire correctly~~
- ~~Test complete form submission workflow~~

**Status**: WP-CLI E2E command provides comprehensive integration testing with real WordPress, Gravity Forms, and SAP B1 integration.

### 2. Add Browser E2E Tests (Optional)
Consider adding browser-based tests using:
- WordPress browser testing tools
- Selenium/Puppeteer for UI testing
- Test actual form submissions in browser
- Test retry button JavaScript functionality

**Priority**: Low - WP-CLI E2E covers most integration scenarios

### 3. Improve Mock Strategies
- Create helper classes for common SAP response patterns
- Build reusable mock factories for Business Partners
- Implement more realistic sequential HTTP mocking

### 4. Performance Testing
- Add tests for large data sets
- Test memory usage with many form submissions
- Verify no memory leaks in long-running processes

## Conclusion
